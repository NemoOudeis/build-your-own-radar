    [**Apache Pulsar**](https://pulsar.apache.org/en/) is an open source pub-sub 
    messaging/streaming platform, competing in a similar space with [Apache Kafka](/radar/tools/apache-kafka).
    It provides expected functionality — such as low-latency async and sync message delivery and scalable persistent storage 
    of messages — as well as various client libraries. What has excited us to evaluate Pulsar is its ease of scalability, 
    particularly in large organizations with multiple segments of users. Pulsar natively supports multitenancy, georeplication, 
    role-based access control and segregation of billing. We're also looking to Pulsar to solve the problem of a never-ending 
    log of messages for our large-scale data systems where events are expected to persist indefinitely and subscribers are able 
    to start consuming messages retrospectively. This is supported through a 
    [tiered storage](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/concepts-tiered-storage/) model. Although Pulsar is a 
    promising platform for large organizations, there is room for improvement. Its current installation requires administering 
    [ZooKeeper and BookKeeper](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/administration-zk-bk/) among other pieces of 
    technology. We hope that with its growing adoption, users can soon count on wider community support.

    Although **infrastructure as code** is a relatively old technique (we’ve featured it in the Radar in 2011), 
    it has become vitally important in the modern cloud era where the act of setting up infrastructure has become the passing 
    of configuration instructions to a cloud platform. When we say ""as code"" we mean that all the good practices we've learned 
    in the software world should be applied to infrastructure. Using source control, adhering to the 
    [DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), modularization, maintainability, and 
    using automated testing and deployment are all critical practices. Those of us with a deep software and infrastructure 
    background need to empathize with and support colleagues who do not. Saying ""treat infrastructure like code"" isn't enough; 
    we need to ensure the hard-won learnings from the software world are also applied consistently throughout the infrastructure realm.

    [**React Hooks**](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) have introduced a new 
    approach to managing stateful logic; given React components have always been closer to functions than classes, 
    Hooks have embraced this and brought state to the functions, instead of taking function as methods to the state with classes. 
    Based on our experience, Hooks improve reuse of functionality among components and code readability. 
    Given Hooks’ testability improvements, using [React Test Renderer](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-renderer.html)
    and [React Testing Library](/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-testing-library), and their growing 
    community support, we consider them our approach of choice.

    [**Open Policy Agent (OPA)**](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) has rapidly become a 
    favorable component of many distributed cloud-native solutions that we build for our clients. OPA provides a 
    uniform framework and [language](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#rego) for declaring, 
    enforcing and controlling policies for various components of a cloud-native solution. It's a great example of a 
    tool that implements [security policy as code](/radar/techniques/security-policy-as-code). We've had a 
    smooth experience using OPA in multiple scenarios, including deploying resources to K8s clusters, enforcing access control 
    across services in a [service mesh](/radar/techniques/service-mesh) and fine-grained security controls as code 
    for accessing application resources. A recent commercial offering, 
    [Styra's Declarative Authorization Service (DAS)](https://www.styra.com/), eases the adoption of OPA for 
    enterprises by adding a management tool, or control plane, to OPA for K8s with a prebuilt policy library, impact analysis 
    of the policies and logging capabilities. We look forward to maturity and extension of OPA beyond operational services to 
    (big) data-centric solutions.

  name: Long-lived branches with Gitflow

    Five years ago we highlighted the problems with **long-lived branches with Gitflow**. 
    Essentially, long-lived branches are the opposite of continuously integrating all changes to the source code, 
    and in our experience continuous integration is the better approach for most kinds of software development. 
    Later we extended our caution to [Gitflow](/radar/techniques/gitflow) itself, 
    because we saw teams using it almost exclusively with long-lived branches. Today, we still see teams in 
    settings where continuous delivery of web-based systems is the stated goal being drawn to long-lived branches. 
    So we were delighted that the author of Gitflow has now added a note to his 
    [original article](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), explaining that 
    Gitflow was not intended for such use cases.
